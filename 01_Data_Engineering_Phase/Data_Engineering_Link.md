# Samba Data Engineering Phase (External Reference)

The **data engineering pipeline** for this analytics project is managed in a separate repository:

ðŸ‘‰ [Samba_Data_Engineering_Project](https://github.com/founa67/Samba_Data_Engineering_Project)

That project includes:
- Raw data ingestion and validation
- ETL/ELT workflows (Python, Airflow, Snowflake)
- Data cleaning, transformation, and modeling
- Table creation scripts for all `PRODUCTION.*` entities

This analytics repository starts **after the ELT pipeline** â€” focusing exclusively on **SQL data analysis, business intelligence, and dashboard insights.**
